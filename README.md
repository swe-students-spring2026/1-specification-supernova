## User Requirements

1. As a group fridge user, I want to label items as mine or shared so that everyone knows what they are allowed to take.
2. As a group fridge user, I want to see who owns each item so that I don’t accidentally take someone else’s food.
3. As a group fridge user, I want to locate my items easily so that I don’t mistake other people’s food for mine.
4. As a group fridge user, I want to know whether shared items are finished so that I can plan groceries accordingly.
5. As a group fridge user, I want to view a simple activity history so that fridge usage feels transparent.
6. As a group fridge user, I want to leave notes on items (like “don’t eat” or “for dinner”) so that we avoid misunderstandings.
7. As a group fridge user, I want to notify others when food needs to be eaten soon so that we reduce waste.
8. As a group fridge user, I want to announce when I add shared food so that others know it is available.
9. As a group fridge user, I want to flag spoiled food so that someone can remove it quickly.
10. As a group fridge user, I want to mark items as thrown away so that others don’t look for them afterwards.
11. As a group fridge user, I want to be notified when someone edits or removes my items so that I stay informed.
12. As a group fridge user, I want to invite or remove members from the fridge group so that only authorized people have access.
13. As a group fridge user, I want to manage shared rules (like shelf usage or food categories) so that everyone follows the same system.
